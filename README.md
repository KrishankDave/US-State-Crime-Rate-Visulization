# Crime Data Analysis Summary

This Tableau visualization shows a bar chart of crime counts by type in the US. The data reveals:

- **Highest frequency crimes**: Theft (58,434 incidents) and Battery (46,080 incidents) are by far the most common crimes recorded.

- **Moderate frequency crimes**: Criminal damage (26,347), Assault (18,521), Deceptive practice (18,178), and Other offense (16,637) represent the next tier of crime frequency.

- **Lower frequency crimes**: The visualization shows many crime types with fewer than 10,000 incidents, including Burglary, Narcotics, Motor vehicle theft, and Robbery.

- **Least common crimes**: Several crimes have very low incident counts (under 100), including Homicide (6), Human trafficking (8), and Public indecency (9).

The visualization includes a comprehensive range of crime categories and appears to be drawing from a detailed crime dataset that includes geographical coordinates and other metadata, as indicated by the available fields in the left panel.

# Crime Trends Analysis for 2018 - Summary

This Tableau visualization shows monthly crime counts and arrest rates throughout 2018:

- **Monthly crime volume**: The line chart displays two distinct trends:
  - Upper blue line: Overall crime counts (around 6,000-8,500 incidents per month)
  - Lower orange line: Arrest counts (around 1,500-2,000 arrests per month)

- **Seasonal pattern**: January shows the highest crime rate (approximately 8,500 incidents with 7.94% of annual crimes), followed by a significant drop in February and relatively stable numbers for the remainder of the year (ranging between 6.39%-6.74%).

- **Arrest data**: The visualization tracks arrest rates (shown as True/False in the legend) across months, with arrest percentages remaining fairly consistent throughout the year at approximately 1.6-1.8% of crimes.

- **Filter controls**: The year is filtered to 2018 data only, and the visualization includes options to filter by arrest status.

This dashboard provides a clear monthly breakdown of crime incidents and corresponding arrest rates, highlighting the January spike as the most notable pattern in the 2018 data.

# Crime Distribution by Type 

This Tableau visualization shows crime data using a bubble chart, where each bubble represents a different crime category and the size indicates frequency:

- **Largest crime categories**: Theft (pink/salmon bubble) appears to be the most prevalent crime, followed by Battery (orange), Criminal Damage (olive/brown), and Other Offense (green).

- **Medium frequency crimes**: Several mid-sized bubbles represent crimes with moderate occurrence rates, including Assault (light blue), Burglary (peach), Narcotics (brown), Deceptive Practice (teal), Motor Vehicle Theft (light purple), and Robbery (teal).

- **Low frequency crimes**: Numerous smaller bubbles represent less common offenses such as Weapons Violation, Criminal Trespass, and various other specialized crime categories.

- **Crime diversity**: The visualization displays approximately 30 distinct crime categories (as shown in the legend on the right), providing a comprehensive view of crime distribution by type across districts.

The bubble chart effectively conveys both the variety of crimes and their relative frequency in a single visualization, with the positioning of bubbles allowing for visual grouping of related crime categories.

# Crime Distribution by Community Area 

This Tableau visualization shows crime data distributed across different community areas, represented as a stacked bar chart:

- **High-crime areas**: The chart shows significant disparity in crime rates, with a few community areas (particularly areas 8, 29, and 43) experiencing substantially higher crime rates - reaching up to 14,000 incidents in the highest crime area.

- **Crime distribution**: The stacked bars represent different crime types (color-coded according to the legend), showing how the composition of crimes varies across communities. Theft (pink), Battery (orange), and Assault (light blue) appear to be dominant crime types in most areas.

- **Crime pattern**: There's a clear descending pattern from left to right, with crime rates declining steadily across community areas, forming a classic long-tail distribution. A small number of areas account for a disproportionate amount of crime.

- **Geographic specificity**: Each community area is identified by its numerical ID (shown along the x-axis) rather than by name, suggesting this is likely data from a specific metropolitan area divided into numbered districts.

The visualization effectively highlights the concentration of crime in certain community areas and shows how crime composition varies across these areas.
