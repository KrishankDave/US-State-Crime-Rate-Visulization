# Crime Data Analysis Summary

This Tableau visualization shows a bar chart of crime counts by type in the US. The data reveals:

- **Highest frequency crimes**: Theft (58,434 incidents) and Battery (46,080 incidents) are by far the most common crimes recorded.

- **Moderate frequency crimes**: Criminal damage (26,347), Assault (18,521), Deceptive practice (18,178), and Other offense (16,637) represent the next tier of crime frequency.

- **Lower frequency crimes**: The visualization shows many crime types with fewer than 10,000 incidents, including Burglary, Narcotics, Motor vehicle theft, and Robbery.

- **Least common crimes**: Several crimes have very low incident counts (under 100), including Homicide (6), Human trafficking (8), and Public indecency (9).

The visualization includes a comprehensive range of crime categories and appears to be drawing from a detailed crime dataset that includes geographical coordinates and other metadata, as indicated by the available fields in the left panel.
